# How to update the website

### Update Data:

* Note: you don't need to edit the "code" just change the arrays. 

* look in src/components/files

* roster.jsx should be updated with the current roster. Take a look at the format (it has to match exactly) but it shouldn't be that hard

* news.jsx should be updated periodically with team news

* currContacts.jsx should be updated with the new people in each position

* scheduleHelp.jsx should be updated with the schedule as soon as it is available, again follow the format of the previous ones

* Rules probably don't need to be updated

### Update Images:

* To update an image just put a new image in its place with the same name

* look in src/components/images:

* "newsImage.png" is the image in the news section on the front page 

* The donateQR.png should be the venmo of the current chief

* update the roster images in the roster folder with an image of the person titled <lastname>.jpeg it has to be exactly like that

* update the slideshow images in the slideshow folder if you want, it only takes 4 images titled 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc

* No need to touch logo.png
