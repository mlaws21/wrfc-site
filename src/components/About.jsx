            The Williams Rugby Football Club (WRFC) was founded by David Coughlin '61 in the spring of 1959 following spending a 
            year studying abroad at Oxford University in England. Starting with a handful of incoming freshmen with experience 
            playing rugby while studying in England, the Club was formed and supported by Peter Pearson, the first Williams Rugby coach. 
            The following fall, the WRFC entered the Eastern Rugby Union (ERU) and won the ERU Championship in 1960 with a 5-0-1 record. 
            Following a 1961 tour in England, support and recognition from the College increased dramatically.
