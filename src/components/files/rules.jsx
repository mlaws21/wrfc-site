    "The ball must be pitched backwards to your teammates. No forward passes. A team can pitch the ball back and forth to each other as many times as they wish.",
    "There is no blocking to assist your runner.",
    "When you are tackled you have one second to let go of the ball and can't touch it again until you are up from the pile and standing on your feet again.",
    "When you tackle someone, you canâ€™t pick up the fumbled ball until you are on your feet. This is one of the most called penalties on new players. You must be standing up to pick up the ball. You cannot dive on a loose ball.",
    "When you are on defense, and a tackled player is put to the ground, you must make sure you are on your side of the scrumage line (behind the back most foot in the ruck) before you engage in any physical contact with the other team. This is called offside.",
    "Offsides and similar offenses mentioned like playing the ball on the ground are penalties. A penalty requires the offending team to back up 10 meters and gives the offended team a free kick.",
    "If the ball is every knocked forward that is a knock on this results in a scrum.",
    "After a penalty or a knock on the forwards on the team (generally the bigger players) perform a scrum where the ball is rolled into the scrum and both teams drive as hard as they can while the hookers try to kick the ball backwards to the back of there side. If the ball goes out of bounds the forwards perform a lineout. The hooker throws the ball straight down the line between the two teams and the rest of the forwards lift people to grab it", 
    "Some egregious penalties can result in either yellow and red cards. Yellow cards result in 10 minutes in the penalty box or the \"sin bin\" and your team plays man down until the penalty is over. A red card it 20 minutes in the sin bin and the offender is unable to retake the field. These cards can be given out for a myriad of offenses but generally they are for high tackles specifically around the neck.",
    "There are a few ways to score in rugby. The easiest is a \"Try\" (worth 5 points) to score a try, a player must apply downward pressure to the ball in the try zone. You then must kick a \"conversion\" (worth 2 points) from that spot on the field but as close or far from the uprights as you would like. Furthermore at any penalty you have the option to \"kick for points\" (worth 3 points) and shoot for the uprights from that spot. Finally as any point you can kick a \"Dumbo\" (worth 3 point). A dumbo is a drop kick at any point during play that goes through the uprights."
